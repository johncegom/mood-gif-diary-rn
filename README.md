# Mood GIF Diary

## Project Overview

**Mood GIF Diary** is a playful, visual journaling app where users express their daily mood by selecting a GIF (via Giphy) that best matches how they feel. Instead of just logging “happy” or “sad,” users search for and save a GIF every day, creating a calendar-like gallery of moods that’s fun to look back on.

## Key Features

- **Daily Mood Logging:**  
  Each day, pick or search for a GIF that represents your mood and save it with an optional note.

- **Giphy API Integration:**  
  Search for GIFs in-app using the Giphy API for endless, hilarious options.

- **Mood Calendar:**  
  Flip through your past mood GIFs in a simple calendar or gallery view. Each day shows the GIF you picked and your note.

- **Notes & Reflections:**  
  Optionally add a short text note alongside your GIF to capture context or feelings.

- **Streaks/Reminders (Optional):**  
  Get a gentle reminder if you forget to log your mood, and see how many days in a row you’ve kept up your diary!
